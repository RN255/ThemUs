## Motivation

I wanted to create a full Sass and also something with user login.

## Tech used
- React
- Bootstrap
- Node JS
- Mongo DB
- Google Auth
- GPT API

## Project features
- Users can sign up and log in
- Users can upgrade to premium using Stripe payments
- Users can create cover letters using the GPT API

## Lessons learnt
- Signing up users with Google Auth
- Connecting a site to the GPT API
- Using stripe to process payments
- Recording everything using Mongo DB

## future development
- It wasn't popular so I took it down. At least I have a blueprint for future Saas with Stripe payments!
