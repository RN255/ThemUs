It can't be yes or no.
How could be recycle slave labour camps?
And what if it's not a yes/no answer.
It's very limiting to be yes/no.

It needs to be right vs left.
In future it could expand to be different party opinions.

How do we do it?

In the beginning.
People have to say if they're left or right.
I will regulate.
It can be very simple.

In future, people might have to sign in.

Smurfs can be downvoted or removed.

Another problem.

Ukraine Russia topics don't divide well into conservative or liberal. We want pro Russian and anti Russian. We want both sides of the debate...

##### How do we solve this? #####

Slave labour camps can keep coming up if they come up with the news. Eg. Everytime we have something new, people can make a new suggestion? But it's going to be very repetitive... no?

Could people choose (I could choose) if it's going to be a for or against
Or a general discussion

Yes they can.

For legal reasons. Everything must be 'sourced' from official media. Nothing more outrageous than what's already on the BBC.
